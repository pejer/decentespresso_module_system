# Decent Espresso module system
Prototype // braindump of extension system.

This is something I put together back in august of 2018. It _worked_ but wasn't amazing. Since then the Decent machine
& tablet have gotten numerous updates and this is nolonger working _as is_. So at the moment - using this code might
make your morning coffee cancelled... and I cannot take resposibility for that or the aftermath.
